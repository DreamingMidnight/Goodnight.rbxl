READ AT OWN RISK ALSO PLEASE IF YOUR A CRINGE GACHA TUBER PLEASE DO NOT BULLY NIMBLZ
If you're reading this I've probably been missing for 2 weeks.
I'm not alive anymore.
On 5/17/2020 I took my own life
You are the best thing that has ever happened to me. Thank you for being with me.
The support and love and friends I've made have kept me going as long as I have.
I definitely wouldn't be writing this if you weren't here for me.
I wanted to keep going until I finished all my projects, but I won't ever be finished with them haha.
My work is one of the few things I can find joy in, and I'm glad I was able to share it with you.
I'm sorry if you expected something more personal
I didn't write any personal letters. That's a lot of writing and everyone would be similar to this.
Good night.
